# Feathered Guardian: A Smart Poultry Litter Tracking   and Alert System
Business problem is Neglecting proper litter management in poultry farming creates an environment that contributes to the buildup of pathogens and ammonia. This posses a threat to the respiratory well-being of birds, increases the risk of diseases and undermines the overall success and sustainability of the poultry enterprise.
Data Annotation is done using Roboflow. Roboflow is a platform designed to streamline the process of managing, annotating, and preparing image datasets for machine learning (ML) and computer vision applications. It offers a range of tools and features to assist ML practitioners and developers in building and deploying image-based models more efficiently.
Model Development is done using YOLO (You Look Only Once): YOLO is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. It was introduced by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, and Ali Farhadi in 2016. YOLO revolutionized object detection by framing it as a single regression problem, making it significantly faster than previous approaches.
Deployement using Streamlit.Streamlit is a popular open-source framework used for building and deploying data-driven web applications quickly. With Streamlit, you can create interactive web applications directly from Python scripts, making it easy for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to share their work with others.
The future of litter tracking projects in poultry farming holds significant promise, with several potential avenues for development and advancement. Some future scopes of litter tracking projects include:
Continued advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies will enable the development of more sophisticated and automated litter tracking systems. Integration of sensors for monitoring parameters such as moisture content, temperature, ammonia levels, and gas emissions will provide real-time data for more precise management of litter conditions.
Leveraging big data analytics and machine learning algorithms will enable deeper analysis of litter data and the identification of complex patterns and correlations. Predictive analytics models can be developed to forecast changes in litter conditions and optimize management practices for improved poultry health and performance.
